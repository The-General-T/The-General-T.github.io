    <p>Welcome to the Invoicing System! Here are some tips:</p>
    <p>Keep in mind, these buttons will make sense.</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Add Item:</strong> Enter the Item Name, the price, then click "Add Item". This is used for new customers, and any customers we may have "issues" with.</li>
      <li><strong>Add Tax Exempt:</strong> Same steps, but click "Add Tax Exempt". This is used for returning/loyal customers as a way to "keep their service"</li>
      <li><strong>Clear Transaction:</strong> Use this after you download/print your invoice.</li>
      <li><strong>Complete Transaction:</strong> When you/your administrator has finalized your invoice, press "Complete Transaction". Then, click Print or Download.</li>
    </ul>
